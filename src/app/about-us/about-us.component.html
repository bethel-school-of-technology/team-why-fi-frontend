                    Hello! I am 23 years old and I am from Philadelphia. I work as a florist and coordinator at a local flower shop.
                    I was raised in a Christian family and got inspiration from my brother in law to try out Bethel Tech.
                    Since joining Bethel my faith has grown so much and I am so excited to see what God has in store for my future.

                    Hello I am 25 years old and I am from Californina. I work as a laboror in a warehouse. I joined bethal in hopes 
                    of being able to provide more for my partner and my 9 month old daughter. I am excited but nervous of the tough road ahead of me 
                    going into a new field.
